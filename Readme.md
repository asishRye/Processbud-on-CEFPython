# Processbud
Processbud running on CEFPython

## Note
Processbud works on top of Tagui. Download Tagui.zip from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ii9FEN3dEBd10ZbkvPsYeYmaBRUKccu3/view?usp=sharing) and extract it to the root of this repo.
This is a slightly modified version of Tagui to disable debugging terminal.

Cef Python doesn't work on Python 3.9, use virtualenv.
```bash
virtualenv ENV -p `path-to-your-python`
```
# Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
